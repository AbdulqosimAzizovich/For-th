Fuel Cards with the Best Discounts

We help you get fuel cards that offer bigger discounts than most, helping you save more money. These cards also have easy payment options and are accepted in many places, making them a great choice for your business. By using these fuel cards, you can better manage your fuel expenses, track your spending, and reduce overall operational costs. Many of our partnered fuel card providers also offer cashback rewards and loyalty programs, giving you additional savings over time. With nationwide coverage, you don’t have to worry about finding a station that accepts your card, ensuring convenience wherever your route takes you.

For example, some of our fuel card partners provide discounts of up to $0.50 per gallon at major truck stops like Pilot, Flying J, and Love’s. These savings add up significantly over time, especially for owner-operators and small fleets. Additionally, many of these cards allow you to set spending limits for drivers, ensuring better financial control. Some fuel cards even offer expense tracking features, which help streamline bookkeeping and tax reporting. By leveraging these benefits, trucking businesses can cut costs while improving financial efficiency.

We help you compare multiple insurance options, making sure you get the best value for your money. Additionally, we connect you with providers who offer flexible payment plans, making it easier to manage your expenses.

We also help businesses find insurance plans with lower deductibles or accident forgiveness programs, reducing financial strain in case of an incident. If you operate in high-risk areas or transport hazardous materials, we ensure you get specialized coverage that meets federal and state regulations. Furthermore, we work with insurers who provide 24/7 claims support, ensuring fast resolution in case of accidents or damages.

Following the Electronic Logging Device (ELD) rules is important for your business. We connect you with trusted ELD providers that offer low-cost solutions with great customer support. They help with setup and provide ongoing assistance to keep everything running smoothly. These ELD solutions ensure compliance with federal regulations, avoiding costly fines and penalties.

Additionally, our partners offer training sessions and 24/7 technical support, making the transition to ELD compliance seamless for businesses of all sizes.

Factoring Companies with Low Fees

Keeping cash flow steady is important. We help you find factoring companies that take a smaller percentage from your earnings, so you keep more of your money. These companies also offer flexible terms and fast payments to help your business stay on track. Instead of waiting weeks for payments, factoring services allow you to access funds within 24 to 48 hours, improving your financial stability. Our partners have transparent pricing, with no hidden fees, so you always know what to expect. Additionally, factoring can help cover expenses like fuel, maintenance, and payroll, ensuring smooth operations without financial stress.

For instance, we work with factoring companies that offer rates as low as 1-3%, allowing you to retain more of your hard-earned revenue. Some factoring services also provide non-recourse options, meaning they take on the risk if a broker or shipper fails to pay. This added security ensures that your business remains financially stable even if a client defaults. Many factoring companies also offer fuel card programs, further helping with day-to-day operating costs. With these benefits, businesses can maintain cash flow and avoid the stress of delayed payments.

This helps your business run safely and efficiently. Our network includes skilled drivers who have undergone thorough background checks, ensuring they meet safety and compliance requirements. We also connect you with drivers who have experience in specific freight types, whether it’s refrigerated goods, dry vans, or hazardous materials. Additionally, by hiring the right drivers, you can reduce turnover rates and build a more reliable and productive team.

For example, our hiring partners conduct extensive screening, including driving record checks, drug tests, and previous employment verification, to ensure only the most qualified drivers join your fleet. We also match businesses with drivers who hold specialized endorsements, such as Hazmat or Tanker certifications, for companies dealing with sensitive cargo. Some of our partners offer driver retention programs, helping businesses reduce turnover by improving job satisfaction. By working with us, you gain access to a pool of skilled drivers who are committed to safety and professionalism.

They also use advanced route optimization tools to reduce fuel costs and minimize downtime. Additionally, having a dedicated dispatcher allows you to focus on driving while they handle negotiations, paperwork, and scheduling to keep your business running smoothly.

For example, our dispatchers have access to premium load boards and industry connections that help secure more profitable routes. They negotiate on your behalf to get better rates per mile, ensuring your business remains competitive. Some dispatch services also provide load planning strategies to minimize deadhead miles, saving fuel and maximizing profits.
